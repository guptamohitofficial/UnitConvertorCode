# codes
Contains all of codes availabled by me 
Yet it contains a c++ code to convert units among each other in 13 diffetrent types of units having several subunits available to convert,
Tried to make it user friendly,
As c++ is a platform dependent language hence it works perfectly on windows and for linux you have to made some changes, or ask me for linux version.



Thankyou ;)
